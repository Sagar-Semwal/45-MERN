45 Days MERN Stack Challenge

This repository is dedicated to the official 45 Days MERN Stack Challenge guided by Aldrin Manon Sir. Over the course of 45 days, a new task or project will be assigned each day to deepen skills and understanding of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

Challenge Overview

The goal of this challenge is to build a variety of real-world projects and solve problems using the MERN stack by following daily tasks. Each task is designed to gradually increase in complexity, helping participants to strengthen their full-stack development capabilities.
